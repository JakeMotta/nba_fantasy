## Feedback
This project had vague / missing requirements, and the assumption that applicants have an understanding of basketball. 

I don't mind the complexity of the project, that makes sense (though it was a bit much for a pre-interview test), but it genuinely felt like no one at EA has actually read the requirements AND tried to build the corresponding app.

As an applicant, I like to try and follow the requirements as they're listed, which makes it very awkward and confusing when the requirements are either contradicting, non-existent, or require guess work. 

## (some) Vague / Missing Requirments
- Minimum team size for creating a team
- What positions NEED to be filled in order to create a team
- 'Single Screen' application that wants 2 screens (though re-reading the requirements, it doesn't actually ask for a 'teams' page)
- JSON data is confusing to people who are not versed w/ basketball
- JSON data doesn't contain player's city name (or anything that looks like it, unless 'standard' is a team I'm unaware of)
- JSON data doesn't contain player's team name, only a team ID with nothing to match it to
- How to handle duplicated players from the JSON data (there are a ton)
- How to handle players with missing data (such as their position)
- A 'desired' image or mockup. I had no idea what you wanted this to look / feel like, so I made this: https://gyazo.com/6ec9a5f74cc93b6ec85ed6d4759b4155
- Expected or allowed tools and tech
