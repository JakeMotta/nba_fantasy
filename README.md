## Feedback
This project upset me, mainly due to the EXTREMELY vague / missing requirements, and the assumption that applicants have a solid understanding of basketball. 

I don't mind the complexity of the project, that makes sense (though it was a bit much for a pre-interview test), but it genuinely felt like no one has at EA has actually read the requirements, and then tried to build the corresponding app.

As an applicant, I like to try and follow ALL the requirements as they're stated, which makes it very awkward when the requirements are either contradicting or non-existent. 

## (some) Vague / Missing Requirments
- Minimum team size for creating a team
- What positions NEED to be filled in order to create a team
- 'Single Screen' application that immediately asks for at least 2 screens
- JSON data is very confusing to people who are not versed w/ basketball
- JSON data doesn't contain player's city name (or anything that looks like it, unless 'standard' is a team I'm unaware of)
- JSON data doesn't container player's team name, only a team ID with nothing to actually match it to
- Should 'created teams' be clickable post-creation
- Any 'desired' image or mockup would have been appreciated, as I have no idea what you wanted this to look / feel like, so I had to make a mockup soley on the project requirements: https://gyazo.com/6ec9a5f74cc93b6ec85ed6d4759b4155.
